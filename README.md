### 1. Research-Based Lesson Design

**Fraction-Decimal Equivalence Lesson**  
*Grade 6 Mathematics | ~60-minute lesson*

A comprehensive, inquiry-based lesson using physical fraction strips to help students discover equivalent fractions and fraction-decimal connections through guided exploration.

**Key Features:**
- 5E instructional model (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate)
- Hands-on manipulatives for concrete understanding
- Formative assessment checkpoints throughout
- Differentiated scaffolding strategies
- Metacognitive reflection activities
- Comprehensive 48-page teacher guide with materials

#### Grades 6-8 Number Systems Curriculum Framework
**Scope and Sequence Development**

A comprehensive curriculum framework mapping 8 mathematical skill areas across middle school grades with vertical alignment and standards-based learning outcomes.

**Framework Components:**
- 8 skill areas: Number Sense, Place Value & Representation, Operations, Factors & Multiples, Fractions & Decimals, Negative Numbers & Integers, Exponents & Powers, Square & Cube Roots
- Broad Understanding Goals for each skill area
- Grade-specific subgoals (Grades 6, 7, 8)
- Topic mapping to curriculum standards
- Estimated lesson pacing guide
- Measurable learning outcomes

**Design Approach:**
Analyzed state mathematics standards to identify core concepts and progression patterns. Organized content under broad skill areas with coherent vertical alignment, ensuring systematic progression from foundational to complex applications.

### 2. Interactive Mathematics Activities

I design interactive digital activities that use game-based learning to support conceptual understanding while maintaining student engagement.

#### Algebra Quest - Interactive Worksheet
**Grade 6 | Introduction to Algebra**

An interactive, gamified worksheet featuring scaffolded algebra challenges across three difficulty levels.

**Pedagogical Features:**
- Progressive difficulty (Easy → Medium → Hard)
- Strategic hint system (costs points, encourages independent thinking)
- Badge system for motivation and achievement
- Immediate feedback with solution explanations
- Self-paced learning accessible on any device

**Design Rationale:** Reduces math anxiety through adventure narrative while providing rigorous practice. The hint system supports struggling learners without removing productive struggle.

#### Prime Numbers Space Shooter
**Grade 6 | Number Theory**

Game-based learning activity where students identify prime numbers through interactive gameplay.

**Pedagogical Features:**
- Multiple difficulty levels for differentiation
- Hint system showing prime factorization
- Achievement tracking for special primes (Mersenne, twin primes)
- Leaderboard system for motivation
- Real-time feedback loop

**Design Rationale:** Gamification transforms prime number practice from memorization to pattern recognition. Students build fluency through spaced repetition within engaging gameplay.

#### Integer Operations Space Game
**Grade 6 | Signed Numbers**

Three-card matching system teaching positive and negative integers using spatial metaphors.

**Pedagogical Features:**
- Multiple representations (numeral, visual, written description)
- Space elevator metaphor (up/down for positive/negative)
- Visual number line with color coding
- Active discovery through gameplay

**Design Rationale:** Spatial reasoning (vertical space) makes abstract negative numbers concrete. Matching multiple representations builds flexible mental models beyond rote memorization.

#### Number System Converter
**Grade 6 | Fractions and Decimals**

Interactive fraction visualizer using manipulable fraction strips with instant visual feedback.

**Pedagogical Features:**
- Visual fraction strips (halves, thirds, fourths, fifths)
- Click to compare and find equivalent fractions
- Instant decimal conversion showing relationships
- Pattern discovery through interaction

**Design Rationale:** Concrete-to-abstract progression where students physically manipulate visual models before moving to symbolic notation. Discovery-based learning reveals mathematical patterns rather than relying on memorization.
